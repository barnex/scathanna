2. Fetch and compile:
```
git clone https://github.com/barnex/scathanna-3d.git
cd scathanna-3d
cargo install --path scathanna
```

3. Edit your preferences in `config.json`. In particular, set your nickname and a server address.
```
cd scathanna-3d
$EDITOR config.json
```

```
{
	"server": "127.0.0.1:3344",   <== set host:port here
	"name": "Nameless Frog",      <== chose a nickname
	"avatar": "hamster",          <== chose frog|panda|turkey|pig|hamster|chicken|bunny
	"movement_keys": "wasd",      <== configure keys (arrow keys always work, too)
	"mouse_sensitivity": 100,
	"window_width": 1024,
	"window_height": 768,
	"window_resizable": false,
	"fullscreen": false,
	"vsync": true,
	"max_fps": 200,
	"msaa": 4,
	"alpha_blending": true
}
```
4. Optional: run a game server

```
cargo run --release --bin scathanna_server 127.0.0.1:3344 deck

```

(where "deck" is the name of a map found in `assets/maps`).


5. Connect to a game server

if you have installed:
```
cd scathanna-3d
scathanna
```

or, without installing:
```
cd scathanna-3d
cargo run --release --bin scathanna
```

## Client options

These are the most options to set in `config.json`:

  * `"server": "host:port"` game server to connect to
  * `"name": "MyName"` sets your nickname
  * `"avatar": frog|panda|turkey|pig|hamster|chicken|bunny` sets how you look


## Graphics/input options

The most useful options are:

  * `"vsync": false` Use this on disable vertical sync on slow hardware if your FPS counter runs below 60 FPS.
  * `"msaa":4` Set anti-aliasing quality (0,1,2,4,8,...). Useful on slow hardware.
  * `"fullscreen": true` Run in borderless fullscreen mode.
  * `"mouse_sensitivity": 100` Set mouse sensitivity (100 = normal speed).
  * `"movement_keys": "wasd"` Choose other movement keys (up, left, down, right). Arrow keys always work regardless of this setting.
